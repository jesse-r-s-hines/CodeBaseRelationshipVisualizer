# CBRV - The CodeBase Relationship Visualizer

Display relationships between files in a codebase, overlayed on a circle packing diagram of the file structure.

Displays nested bubbles, with source code files at the lowest level of the bubbles, visually reminiscent to [Repo Visualizer](https://github.com/githubocto/repo-visualizer) but interactive and zoomable. Also exposes an API that other VSCode extensions can use to build visualizations of different relationships.
